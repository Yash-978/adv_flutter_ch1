## 1 State Management :

Ans -> State management in Dart and Flutter is all about managing the data that the app will render and how it will respond to user input.

## 2 State :

Ans -> State is information that (1) can be read synchronously when the widget is built and (2) might change during the lifetime of the widget.

## 3 SetState :

Ans -> Rebuild the our stateful or stateless widget build method.

## 4 Provider State Management :

Ans -> Provider is a powerful state management solution in Flutter, offering a simple way to manage and share state across your application.

## 5 Provider package :

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  provider: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version
```

## 6 ChangeNotifier Class :

Ans -> ChangeNotifier is a simple class included in the Flutter SDK which provides change notification to its listeners.

## 7 ChangeNotifierProvider Widget :

Ans -> ChangeNotifierProvider is the widget that provides an instance of a ChangeNotifier to its descendants.

## 8 Consumer Widget :

Ans -> The Consumer widget has two main purposes: It allows obtaining a value from a provider when we don't have a BuildContext that is a descendant of said provider, and therefore cannot use Provider.
## 9 Provider Tree :
